        "This tool reads raster files from a folder to create a three dimensional data structure, called data cube. The three dimensions are latitude, longitude and date. The raster files are stacked along the date dimension. This means that every slice corresponded to the raster file of one record. The raster file values will extract and saved as variables for every slice. To separate raster files witch containing data values from mask values, the use has to define the part of the file names to distinguish the files by setting <data_name> and <mask_name>. Optional an <extension> parameter can by set to define the type of raster file to be read from.
