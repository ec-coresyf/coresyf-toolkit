The resulting list of optimal numbers of clusters which summarise the variability in the data are then written back into a new original SeparabilityMeasuresDecision.txt file as a new line in a list form, followed by underpinning decision data. The 1st value on the second line of the SeparabilityMeasuresDecision textfileis the one for the algorithm to select for onward use.",
